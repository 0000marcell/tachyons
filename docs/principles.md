# Principles

## Responsive

Everything should be 100% responsive. Your website should work regardless of a user’s device or screensize.

## Readable

No matter the lighting, or the device, font-sizes should be large enough and contrast should be high enough for your users to easily read your content.

## Modular

Tachyons isn’t just a monolithic framework.
It’s a collection of small modules that can be mixed and matched or used independently.
Use what you need. Leave the rest.

## Accessible

Accessibility is important to us.
Throughout both the css and the documentation we provide numerous tools and methods for making it easier to maximize the accessibility of your site.

## Performant

Code should be optimized for performance.

## Reusable

Clear documentation helps create a shared understanding of design patterns amongst your team.
This helps promote reuse and reduces the amount of redundancy in a codebase.
